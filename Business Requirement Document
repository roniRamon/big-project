<<NICE TO HAVE>> User has to choose the main character: Viking, Warrior Princess, Cheese, 
or Pinecone, and a goal: Save Prince, Milk Cow, Plant a tree, Eat the most delicious ice-cream in 
the world before it melts.<<>> 

User will start the game by giving a name to their character and assigning points to the 
attributes of the character. The main attributes are:
-	Health – Which has to remain above zero in order to keep the character alive. This parameter
might be decreased during the fight. Health recovery will be available at special events 
during the game.

artifacts gathered in selected events or after winning a fight. The base strength of the character
cannot be decreased.

hidden features. By developing this skill, the character might avoid a fight with some of the
creatures, get better deals with merchants and have more item choices from events.

User will be given initial number of points which they need to redistribute between above 
parameters. Depending on their point distribution, the user can create a more defensive 
(higher input on intelligence and health) or offensive (attack and health) character.

character will be able to bribe the opponent instead to avoid the fight.
