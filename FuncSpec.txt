Overview
SomeRPG is a single-player fantasy role-playing video game, played in a browser on both desktop and mobile devices.

Scenarios
Scenario 1: Indie Mindie.
Mindie has played a lot of games in her day and become tired of the AA titles with flashy graphics. Wanting something a tad
more indie, she happens upon SomeRPG. Initially amused by the character choices available to play, she selects Pine Cone and
proceeds to play the game after picking a goal, distributing attributes and entering a name. On her first run her 
intelligence is off the charts, but her strength is low and the resulting game play she found amusing as she proceeded
through the Mountain, Forest, and Desert areas. After retrieving all three penguins required by the python to fight the final
boss of the game. Unfortunately, rng was not in her favor, and she lost the final fight. She intends to start up again after
dinner with a new build to take down A Brick.

Scenario 2: Johnny.
Johnny is a middle school student who, like many students his age, is quite fond of video games and less fond of paying
attention in class. During 5th period (social studies), a particularly boring time of the day, he will often take out his
iPhone to pass time. Sittirite timekng in the back where Ms. Talksalot can’t see, he loads up his favorite time killer:
SomeRPG. He’s played it many times before, but it never gets old because each adventure is different. Today he chooses to
create a viking character with all brawn and no brain. He sets forth on his journey to eat the most delicious ice cream in
the world. As he did so, today he chose to pick a new option he’d never chosen before- he denied the python the penguins.
Unfortunately, the python retaliated and in revenge for not surrendering the penguins he desired, the python ate Johnny’s
character, resulting in a game over. Not a lick of the United States’ westward expansion reached his ears that day—he had his
own Destiny to Manifest.

Scenario 3: Story Rory.
Rory is a pretty casual game player, and isn’t interested in anything with a too complex learning curve. He picks up SomeRPG
at the recommendation of a random banner ad he sees online, and is charmed with its simple appearance. He goes through
character creation and advances through the first few screens of the game. At first put off by the cookie-cutter RPG aspect
of the game, he is soon captivated by the underlying story and continues playing. Not giving much thought to the “game” part
of the game, Rory carries on with the storytelling facet. He immerses himself in his character’s shoes, and reads eagerly to
discover how he will plant the tree that will grow to the heavens. While traveling in the desert, Rory chose for his
character to play Angry Birds. His character died of dehydration and he was met with a “Game Over” screen. Wanting to not be
stumped by a simple browser game, he restarted his character with the knowledge he gained of his first playthrough and
avoided all the pitfalls present in the paths. At long last, Rory made it to the final boss, A Brick. The final battle 
ensued, and in the end, Rory was victorious.
Hooked by the writing of the game, Rory plays through the game over and over again to see the other paths and characters.

Screen by Screen Specification
Home Page
The main page where the entire game will take place. It consists of several subpages that make up each feature of the game.

On this and all other pages, there is a menu at the top-right that lets users navigate to each page. To the left of the menu
is the game’s logo.

Title Screen
Displays the game’s logo in majestic fashion while allowing time to load the game. As the game loads, a loading bar below the
title fills to indicate its progress. Once the game is loaded, a button that says “Start Game” appears, replacing the loading
bar. Clicking on “Start Game” goes to Character Creation.

Character Creation
The left side of Character Creation has a welcome message that introduces the game and instructs the user on creating a
character. The right side shows the customizable options for doing so. Before the user can begin the game, they must complete
the following steps in order:

Input a name
A text field allows the name to be typed, up to 16 alphabetical characters. If there is at least one character inputted, show
the “Next” button, which proceeds to Step 2. //Should we mention if special characters valid? What about spaces?

Choose a character
A drop-down menu contains the predefined characters. They include:
Viking
Warrior Princess
Cheese
Pine Cone
Once a character is chosen, show the “Next” button, which proceeds to Step 3.

Choose a goal
A drop-down menu contains the predefined goals. They include:
Save prince
Milk cow
Plant a tree
Eat the most delicious ice cream in the world before it melts
Once a goal is chosen, show the “Next” button, which proceeds to Step 4.

Allocate attributes
The attributes Health, Strength, and Intelligence are listed with their amount next to them. Plus and minus buttons are next
to the amounts, allowing the number of each attribute to be added to or subtracted from. Once all attribute points are
distributed, the user may begin the game.

Underneath the welcome message is the “Begin Adventure” button that goes to the Main Game. Initially grayed out, it becomes
clickable once the last step is complete.

Main Game
The top portion of the Main Game, known as the Main Screen, displays a background representing the current area of the
character. Artwork may appear in the foreground, representing the character, NPCs, enemies, items, and any other objects that
our artists choose to draw.

The bottom portion, known as the Text Box, displays text about anything occurring in the game. When players are given
multiple actions to choose from, each option will be detailed in this area. The player will then be prompted to click their
desired action.

Interaction with the Text Box
During the game, text will scroll (as a result of dialogue or exposition) in the Text Box. When enough text has been spawned
to fill the Text Box, scrolling will stop and await for a user click to continue scrolling. Upon this user click, the
currently present text will be blanked, and scrolling will continue from the top most position to the bottom of the Text Box.

Character Page/Backpack
The left side of Character Page shows information about the character, including Name, Character, Goal, Attributes, and Money.
The right side shows the Backpack which contains the character’s possessions.

Game Over Screen
Shows the words “Game Over” in majestic fashion. Underneath, a “Restart” button brings the player back to the Title Screen.

Options
Lists settings that can be changed by the user:
Music Volume: Adjustable slider that goes from 0% to 100% volume. Default: 100%.
Font size: Five buttons that will change font size, from very small to very large. Default: Normal.
Font colour: A dropdown menu listing all available text colour options. Default: Black.
Text speed: ‘Slow’, ‘Normal’, ‘Fast’ options for text speed. Default: Normal.

Hints Page
Contains hints and tips to the game that will aid any users that may be having difficulty progressing.
	Ex: Having trouble finding out where to go? Talk to the townsfolk!
	       Is a lack of an item holding you back? Investigate even the weirdest places! You never know what you’ll find.
	       Too weak to beat the bear? If you’re smart enough, try talking them down!
	       Not smart enough to outwit the merchant? Break his legs! Not saying the town won’t come after you, though...

About Page
Contains information about the game/project and the team that worked on it.



Story (rough)              
//see flowchart reference

Begin Adventure
After “Begin Adventure” is pressed, present the backstory for their chosen goal. Start the tutorial after all the text is scrolled.

Event T: Tutorial
Go over the basics: Character Page, Backpack, Options, and the Hints Page. Describe what they’ll find in each of those places. 
Have them pick up an item to demonstrate the backpack’s usage. Then have the player make their way to Hub City while teaching
them how to choose from several actions, starting first with the crossroad area tutorial. All Areas will be grayed out and
inaccessible aside from Hub City. 

Hub City
Once the player is in Hub City, continue the story (python asks player to get penguins?). From this point, the player can
choose to adventure to one of the three other locations: Desert, Forest, or Mountain.

When a player returns to Hub City after an Event, adventuring to a location will place them where they last were at that
location.

When Events P1, P2, and P3 are complete, present the appropriate story dialogue, and Event Z1 occurs after.

Events 1, 2, 3
After completing an Event of this category, the player may choose to return to Hub City or continue onward.

Event P: Penguins
After completing an Event P, the player is sent back to Hub City. The location for that Event P is then closed and cannot be
accessed from the Crossroads.
