# Event 2: Ascending The Peak #
###############################

You enter the Mountains. The penguin could be anywhere, but something tells you the only logical path to finding it 
would involve scaling the highest peak. Several monotonous hours after you begin your ascent, you come across a fairy. 
You could use a little break, and she's genuinely interested in how such an intriguing creature has found itself in 
the mountains.  After some time spent discussing your adventures, you catch the glisten of a jewel-encrusted sword in 
her backpack, it looks powerful. She notices your gaze and understands what it means; You want the sword.
"Please, this sword is a family heirloom. It's value to me cannot be measured in coin; It's not for sale."
A) Fight her for the sword
B) Leave her alone and continue your journey
C) Ask if she would like to join your adventure

Go left (will be elaborated)

	There's a foul stench on the air. You pause to take in your surroundings, but it's too late; It's an ambush!          
	You're quickly surrounded by orcs and are ordered to lower your weapon.
	A) (if you have sword or fairy) "He has/they have the Warchief's sword!" (begin fight)  
	 + (if you have the fairy) "Well I didn't say it was MY family's heirloom, did I?"
	B) Pay them gold to let you leave
	C) Convince them you are a powerful wizard and THEY SHALL LET YOU PASS (intelligence)
	 If intelligence check fails, fight them.

Go right (will be elaborated)  (You have for option to click one or both choices or just continue ahead)

	As you continue your trek up the perilous peak, the path before you grows increasingly worn. You come across 		
	the burning embers of a campfire.
	A) -Investigate the firepit-
	  As you step forward to investigate the firepit, the fairy exclaims "This was no ordinary fire!". She quickly 	  
	  grabs a bag of dust out of her pocket and sprinkles it upon the dying embers. In a glorious blaze of fire, a 
	  phoenix is reborn! In return for rejuvenating him, he grants you his crown of fire (extra health).
	B) -Someone left a bag of candy. You can't let it go to waste, it's your favorite kind.-
	  It was poisoned, you die.

Continue--
As you finally scale the crest of the mountain and step upon the summit, the mountain below you rumbles ominously. 
Time is of the essence. Also, it occurs to you how silly you're going to feel if the penguin wasn't up here after all. 
Your path finally leads you to a dark cave. Perhaps the penguin is inside, Perhaps it could be something else.
	A) -Leave, there must be another path-
	 As you make your way back down to search for another path, the ground beneath you shatters violently. Lava 		 
	 spews up from within the mountain and you are incinerated.
	B) -There's no turning back now, you boldly venture in-
	 The air is unnaturally warm and muggy. Amongst the pitch black canopy, two large menacing eyes reveal 		         
	 themselves; It's a dragon! He turns on the lights so everyone can see better, and you notice a fuzzy white 	 
	 creature nestled in his tail. IT'S THE PENGUIN. "Can't you see I'm taking a nap? You are not welcome here,               
	 leave." The rumbles of the mountain grow increasingly violent, there's no time to waste.
		A)-(If you have fairy) Let the fairy talk to the dragon-
          	 Turns out they're actually good friends. The dragon gives you the penguin and flies you back to the 			 
          	 city as the mountain begins to rupture. Your trio looks particularly stoic as you make your escape 		 
          	 amongst the jets of scalding lava.
		B)-Fight the dragon-
          	 If successful, he submits to your will, granting you the penguin and flying you back to the city. You 		 
          	 look particularly stoic as you make your escape amongst the jets of scalding lava
