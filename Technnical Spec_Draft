Ad a: message “Python ate you instead of penguins”
Ad b: message “Python lets you through.” Brick Event Z2 is enabled. Button “Go to Bricks Hut”

3.1.10.1	Backpack  

NICE TO HAVE : in version 1.2

3.2	Variables and objects

-	Health : int
-	Strength : int

-	Knife : Artifact
-	Sword : Artifact
-	Apple : Artifact

-	FightOpponent : int // your opponents result of the fight random selected number multiplied by current strength


3.3	Players attributes 
Player will have 3 main attributes:
...


3.4	Artifacts

Following artifacts will be available to collects in various events and their influence on Character’s parameters :

Name	Strength	Health	Intelligence
Knife	+10		
Sword	+ 40		
Super Sword		+ 60
