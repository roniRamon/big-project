The goal of the game (selected by the user) is protected by the evil but mysterious cuboid monster, The Brick.

Player will go through series of events in this location. 
In the 1.0 version Player will go through all Mountains events and only after finishing it will be able to go to other location. 

NICE TO HAVE: After finishing each event Player will be able to choose if they want to go to the next event or want to return to the City. In case Player returns to the city system will remember which was the last finished event in the location which was left. After coming back to the Forest again system will open the first not started event

Once Player collects all penguins and will come to the Python’s Nest option appears:

3.1.10.1	Backpack  

NICE TO HAVE : in version 1.2

3.2	Variables and objects

-	Health : int
-	Strength : int 
-	Intelligence: int

-	PenguinCount : int
-	Backpack : Artefacts [] 
-	Knife : Artefact
-	Sword : Artefact

-	Whiskey : Artefact
-	FightYou : int // your result of the fight random selected number multiplied by current strength
-	FightOpponent : int // your opponents result of the fight random selected number multiplied by current strength


3.3	Players attributes 
Player will have 3 main attributes:
...


3.4	Artefacts

Following artefacts will be available to collects in various events and their influence on Character’s parameters :

Name	Strength	Health	Intelligence
Knife	+10		
Sword	+ 40		
Super Sword		+ 60		
Whiskey			+10		-15
Apple			+25/+15*	
…			

Some of the artefacts and goods (food items) if consumed in place will have lower impact on the character’s parameters than if Played would insert them in their backpack. For example: Apple will give 25 to Health if is located in the backpack and only 15 when eaten on the spot. 




3.5	Strategies and Motivations

User can try to develop their character in more defensive or offensive way depending on the strategy of assigning points and collecting artefacts.
