GM: are now very very thirsty. Luckily you do have your iphone 5s on you. 
GM: You decide to locate yourself on the map. You pull your iphone out. 
GM: Unfortunately, the wifi does not work! Desperate, you look around your 
GM: surroundings for water. You see no signs of water in your immediate 
GM: path.

  GM: wifi. You ask siri where to find water and siri points you towards
  GM: Cactus Island about 10 miles away. As you continue to walk, you feel
  GM: tired as hell. You really want to stop walking. You look up into the 
  GM: sky and notice the clouds are getting heavy and dark. Is this a sign 
  GM: of rain? 
  GM: What do you do?
  GM: <button>1 => Wait for rain</button>
  GM: <button>2 => Continue walking towards Cactus Island</button>
  </p>

    GM: your phone is receiving wifi again. You look up the weather and 
    GM: notice the weather app says it will only be cloudy. You do some
    GM: research and realize that it does not rain here. You decide to 
    GM: once again walk towards Cactus Island, 1 mile down the road.

    GM: Island. What a heavenly place!! You pick up a cactus, open it, 
    GM: drink the water, and are now replenished! You decide to pack
    GM: your bag with a cactus to last yourself with at least another
    GM: week's worth of water supply.
    </p>

    GM: the hole you've dug.
    GM: You die.
    </p>

  else ( <button>2 => Continue walking</button> )
    <p>
    GM: You decide to continue walking. Within 4 hours, your phone begins
    GM: to receive wifi signal. You pull out your phone and google for the
    GM: nearest area with water. Siri tells you to goto Cactus Island
    GM: which is located 5 miles from where you are. You begin walking 
    GM: towards Cactus Island. 
    GM: change scenes to 2. Cactus Island
    </p>

  GM: the nearest area with water. Siri tells you to goto Cactus Island,
  GM: which is located 25 miles from where you are.

    </p>

  else( <button>2 => Continue walking towards the path you came from</button> )
    <p>
    GM: You decide to continue walking. Within 2 miles you notice a 
    GM: python crawling around the desert.
    GM: What do you do?
    GM: <button>1 => Ignore the python</button>
    GM: <button>2 => Attempt to kill the python for its meat and blood</button>
    </p>

    if( <button>1 => Ignore the python</button> )
      <p>
      GM: You decide to ignore the python and walk. As you begin to walk,
      GM: the python sneaks up from behind you. Before you can do anything 
      GM: to stop it, it wraps itself around you. 
      GM: health: -5
      GM: Fortunately, the snake is also weak due to dehydration. You are able
      GM: to rip it apart and eat + drink its blood.
      GM: You feel rejuvenated and continue walking until you make it to the city.

      GM: You run unto the python and grab it by its mouth. The snake 
      GM: wiggles for a minute and then becomes motionless. You eat

3.1.10.1	Backpack  

NICE TO HAVE : in version 1.2

3.2	Variables and objects

-	FightOpponent : int // your opponents result of the fight random selected number multiplied by current strength


3.3	Players attributes 
Player will have 3 main attributes:
...


3.4	Artifacts

Following artifacts will be available to collects in various events and their influence on Character’s parameters :

Name	Strength	Health	Intelligence
Knife	+10		
Sword	+ 40		
Super Sword		+ 60
