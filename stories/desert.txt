# Story 2: Desert Water #
#########################

GM: For whatever reason, it is your 3rd day wandering aimlsesly around the 
GM: desert. You realize you haven't had water since the adventure and you
GM: are now very very thirsty. Luckily you do have your iphone 5s on you. 
GM: You decide to locate yourself on the map. You pull your iphone out. 
GM: Unfortunately, the wifi does not work! Desperate, you look around your 
GM: surroundings for water. You see no signs of water in your immediate 
GM: path. 
GM: What do you do?
GM: => 1. Continue walking
GM: => 2. Dig into the ground
GM: => 3. Walk in the opposite path

  GM: 1. Continue walking
  GM: You decide to keep walking. Within a few miles, your phone picks up 
  GM: wifi. You ask siri where to find water and siri points you towards
  GM: Cactus Island about 10 miles away. As you continue to walk, you feel
  GM: tired as hell. You really want to stop walking. You look up into the 
  GM: sky and notice the clouds are getting heavy and dark. Is this a sign 
  GM: of rain? 
  GM: What do you do?
  GM: 1 => Wait for rain
  GM: 2 => Continue walking towards Cactus Island

    GM: 1. Wait for rain
    GM: You decide to wait. Your phone has no wifi so you decide to play 
    GM: Angry Birds while you wait for the rain. 4 hours has passed and 
    GM: your phone is receiving wifi again. You look up the weather and 
    GM: notice the weather app says it will only be cloudy. You do some
    GM: research and realize that it does not rain here. You decide to 
    GM: once again walk towards Cactus Island, but you die of dehydration 
    GM: 1 mile down the road.

    GM: 2. Continue walking towards Cactus Island
    GM: You decide to continue walking. You finally arrive at Cactus
    GM: Island. What a heavenly place!! You pick up a cactus, open it, 
    GM: drink the water, and are now replenished! You decide to pack
    GM: your bag with a cactus to last yourself with at least another
    GM: week's worth of water supply.

  GM: 2. Dig into the ground
  GM: You dig into the ground. 4 hours in, you've come to the realization 
  GM: that you've made no progress so far. 
  GM: What do you do?
  GM: 1 => Continue digging
  GM: 2 => Dig elsewhere
  GM: 3 => Continue walking

    GM: 1. Continue digging
    GM: You continue to dig. As you continue to dig, you begin to feel 
    GM: nauseous and fever-ish. Within the next minute, you fall into 
    GM: the hole you've dug.

    GM: 2. Dig elswhere
    GM: You come to the realization that the hole you've dug contains no
    GM: water, so you decide to dig elsewhere. You dig and dig and die.

    GM: 3. Continue walking
    GM: You decide to continue walking. Within 4 hours, your phone begins
    GM: to receive wifi signal. You pull out your phone and google for the
    GM: nearest area with water. Siri tells you to goto Cactus Island
    GM: which is located 5 miles from where you are. You begin walking 
    GM: towards Cactus Island. Unfortunately you fall flat on your face 
    GM: and die within the next mile.

  GM: 3. Walk in the opposite path
  GM: You decide to walk in the path you came from. Within 4 hours, your 
  GM: phone picks up wifi signal. You pull out your phone and google for 
  GM: the nearest area with water. Siri tells you to goto Cactus Island,
  GM: which is located 25 miles from where you are.
  GM: What do you do?
  GM: 1 => Walk towards Cactus Island
  GM: 2 => Continue walking towards the path you came from

    GM: 1. Walk towards Cactus Island
    GM: You fall into your own death within the 2nd mile to dehydration.

    GM: 2. Continue walking towards the path you came from
    GM: You decide to continue walking. Within 2 miles you notice a 
    GM: python crawling around the desert.
    GM: What do you do?
    GM: 1 => Ignore the python
    GM: 2 => Attempt to kill the python for its meat and blood

    GM: 1. Ignore the python
    GM: You decide to ignore the python and walk. As you begin to walk,
    GM: the python sneaks up from behind you. Before you can do anything 
    GM: to stop it, it wraps itself around you. Too weak to fight back, 
    GM: you lay idled until your own breath. Well, at least a life is 
    GM: saved.

    GM: 2. Attempt to kill the python for its meat and blood
    GM: You run upto the python and grab it by its mouth. The snake 
    GM: wiggles for a minute and then becomes motionless. You eat 
    GM: the python and feel rejuvinated. You continue to walk and barely 
    GM: made it back to the city.

You enter a pyramid. Curiosity got the best of you and you decided to enter the pyramid.
As you walk in, the door shuts tight and you are now trapped. You notice three items 
floating magically above a stone. Which of these items do you pick up?
1: compass
2: flame torch
3: stack of gold

You decide to pick up <ITEM>. The other items turns into dust. You walk down the path 
and a mummy suddenly appears from no where. You…
1: run for your life
2: fight the mummy
3: talk to the mummy

    => 1: You run for your life. Along the way, you fall into a pit trap.
    You are lost. You continue walking around looking for an exit. 
    * If you picked the compass, you find the exit
    * Else, you continue to walk around looking for an exit. You suddenly see a glimpse 
    of light, but there are 50 tombs surrounding it. As you walk closer to the glimpse 
    of light, the tombs open and the mummies all come out of it.
    * If you picked the flame torch, you pull it out and all the mummies get scared 
    and goes back into their tomb. You exit safely.
    * Else, you run in the opposite direction and FALL into another pit trap.

    20 days have gone by and you are still lost. You look at the stack of gold you’ve
    picked up and feel stupid. All of a sudden, an angel mummy appears. It tells you
    that you have learned your lesson. In return, it wants the stack of gold back plus 
    $1000.
    * If you don’t have $1000, the angel mummy tells you “TOO BAD”, gives an evil laugh
    and disappears.
    * Else, you hand it the gold + money. You magically appear outside the pyramid.

    => 2: You decide to fight the mummy. 
    * If you didn’t pick the flame torch, you die.
