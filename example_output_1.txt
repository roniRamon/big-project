GM: For whatever reason, it is your 3rd day wandering aimlsesly around the 
GM: desert. You realize you haven't had water since the adventure and you
GM: are now very very thirsty. Luckily you do have your iphone 5s on you. 
GM: You decide to locate yourself on the map. You pull your iphone out. 
GM: Unfortunately, the wifi does not work! Desperate, you look around your 
GM: surroundings for water. You see no signs of water in your immediate 
GM: path. 
GM: What do you do?
GM: => 1. Continue walking
GM: => 2. Dig into the ground
GM: => 3. Walk in the opposite path

  GM: 1. Continue walking
  GM: You decide to keep walking. Within a few miles, your phone picks up 
  GM: wifi. You ask siri where to find water and siri points you towards
  GM: Cactus Island about 10 miles away. As you continue to walk, you feel
  GM: tired as hell. You really want to stop walking. You look up into the 
  GM: sky and notice the clouds are getting heavy and dark. Is this a sign 
  GM: of rain? 
  GM: What do you do?
  GM: 1 => Wait for rain
  GM: 2 => Continue walking towards Cactus Island

    GM: 1. Wait for rain
    GM: You decide to wait. Your phone has no wifi so you decide to play 
    GM: Angry Birds while you wait for the rain. 4 hours has passed and 
    GM: your phone is receiving wifi again. You look up the weather and 
    GM: notice the weather app says it will only be cloudy. You do some
    GM: research and realize that it does not rain here. You decide to 
    GM: once again walk towards Cactus Island, but you die of dehydration 
    GM: 1 mile down the road.

    GM: 2. Continue walking towards Cactus Island
    GM: You decide to continue walking. You finally arrive at Cactus
    GM: Island. What a heavenly place!! You pick up a cactus, open it,

  GM: 3 => Continue walking

    GM: 1. Continue digging

    GM: the hole you've dug.

    GM: 2. Dig elswhere
    GM: You come to the realization that the hole you've dug contains no
    GM: water, so you decide to dig elsewhere. You dig and dig and die.

    GM: 3. Continue walking
    GM: You decide to continue walking. Within 4 hours, your phone begins
    GM: to receive wifi signal. You pull out your phone and google for the
    GM: nearest area with water. Siri tells you to goto Cactus Island
    GM: which is located 5 miles from where you are. You begin walking 
    GM: towards Cactus Island. Unfortunately you fall flat on your face 
    GM: and die within the next mile.

  GM: 3. Walk in the opposite path
  GM: You decide to walk in the path you came from. Within 4 hours, your 
  GM: phone picks up wifi signal. You pull out your phone and google for 
  GM: the nearest area with water. Siri tells you to goto Cactus Island,
  GM: which is located 25 miles from where you are.
  GM: What do you do?
  GM: 1 => Walk towards Cactus Island
  GM: 2 => Continue walking towards the path you came from

    GM: 1. Walk towards Cactus Island
    GM: You fall into your own death within the 2nd mile to dehydration.

    GM: 2. Continue walking towards the path you came from
    GM: You decide to continue walking. Within 2 miles you notice a 
    GM: python crawling around the desert.
    GM: What do you do?
    GM: 1 => Ignore the python
    GM: 2 => Attempt to kill the python for its meat and blood

    GM: 1. Ignore the python
    GM: You decide to ignore the python and walk. As you begin to walk,
    GM: the python sneaks up from behind you. Before you can do anything 
    GM: to stop it, it wraps itself around you. Too weak to fight back, 
    GM: you lay idled until your own breath. Well, at least a life is 
    GM: saved.

    GM: 2. Attempt to kill the python for its meat and blood
    GM: You run upto the python and grab it by its mouth. The snake 
    GM: wiggles for a minute and then becomes motionless. You eat 
    GM: the python and feel rejuvinated. You continue to walk and barely 
    GM: made it back to the city.
