# Desc: It would be nice to see an example of how the game works. The 
#       purpose of this file is to display a possible outcome of the game.

# Note: This hypothetical output is an example of a game from start to end.
#       "GAME>" is followed by the output from the program.
#       "=>" requires user input.
#
# Please keep in mind that the actual game is implemented using html and 
# javascript/jquery

Game> [some more text]
Game> [and some more]
Game> What would you like to do?
Game> Options: Fight, Find Artifacts, Meet Other Creature
=> Fight

# a creature object is randomly selected from the creatures array/class
Game> A Wild Book (4/4) has appeared! 
Game> What would you like to do?
Game> Options: Hit, Item, Run
=> Hit

# the following is calculated by doing rand(player_1.strength) + 1
Game> You hit Wild Book for 4 damage!

# picking up potion is a random event
# Attributes should also go up a fixed amount (like 0.1 for each). User 
# should be notified if an attribute increases by 1 point.
Game> You defeated Wild Book, picked up 1x potion, and â€¦


# ok im stuck on the idea
# also how would events be implemented?
