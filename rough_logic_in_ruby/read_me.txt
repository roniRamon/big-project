# To run this project, type in the terminal:
# $ rb game.rb
#
# This folder consists of some logic for the intro part of the project.
# I wasn't able to implement this using javascript since my knowledge is 
# limited, so I decided to write some code using ruby just to get a feel 
# for the logic.
#
# So far, I made a
# 1) Game class - consists of the game
# 2) Characters Module - consists of all the properties/fields and methods for
#                       the hero and villain class.
# 3) Data Module - consists of a bunch of hashes used to store data
# 4) Tool Module - consist of methods used to format the output

#
# I'll continue to work on this whenever I feel like burning time or
# testing out logical stuff (probably not though).
#
# Feel free to modify/edit/add anything to this folder.
